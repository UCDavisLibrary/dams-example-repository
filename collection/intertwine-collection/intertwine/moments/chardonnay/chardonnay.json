    "description" : "Born in Princeton, Illinois, Joe Heitz moved to Jack Murphy Stadium while enlisted in the U.S. Air Force. Following World War II, Heitz began taking classes at UC Davis, achieving a bachelor and eventually a master's degree in viticulture and enology as part of the first graduating class of seven to do so in 1951. Heitz found employment under the wine industry extremes, first at Gallo, and then in 1951 under André Tchelistcheff at Beaulieu Vineyard as an assistant winemaker where he worked for nearly ten years.\n\n In 1961, after having worked as a professor at the enology program at California State University, Fresno for four years, Heitz and his wife Alice bought a small 8.5-acre (3.4 ha) vineyard from Leon Brendel named \"The One & Only\" (later, Heitz Wine Cellar) for $5,000 planted with grignolino, and went into business for himself. His winemaking production preceded Robert Mondavi's emergence in Oakville.\n\n In 1963, Heitz bought at an auction several barrels of Chardonnay and Pinot Noir wine from Hanzell Vineyards in Sonoma, the last vintages of the deceased owner James D. Zellerbach's pursuit of Burgundian excellence sold off by his widow. Heitz blended the wines with success, achieving lucrative prices for the times. A stated strategy for success was to pay growers \"what their grapes were worth\", in turn increasing the standard of the product he was receiving. In 1964, Heitz acquired an 1898 stone winery with its 160-acre (65 ha) ranch property, which became the Heitz winery and home, with the original winery retained as a visitor's centre.",

Stony Hill may have been the first winery to plant a Chardonnay vineyard after Prohibition, and the McCreas did so despite warnings from UC Davis that the variety was unlikely to succeed.

Producers like Stony Hill Vineyard and Hanzell began to work with the grape with great success in the 1950s, but it existed purely on the margins; in 1960 there were only around 150 documented acres of Chardonnay in the state. But its popularity continued to grow at a rapid pace in the 1960s, and after Chateau Montelena's Chardonnay bested some of Burgundy's most iconic wines in the 1976 Judgment of Paris, Chardonnay's boom was supersonic.", "Chardonnay and its parent, Pinot noir, are the two classic varieties used in Champagne, in which Chardonnay’s neutral character leaves space for the expression of the mellow aromas developed in the bottle. The finesse of fine Chardonnay wines, opined winemaker, Eleanor Mcrea, \"is as unmistakable as Beethoven, [yet] there are many variations on the theme.\" That Chardonnay \"responds gracefully to many approaches\" makes it a canvas for the expression of vineyard and vinification. While some pioneering Chardonnay producers in California sought to reproduce the high acid, crisp style of Chablis, or of the richer quality of Burgundy white, still others have worked with riper grapes, acid-lowering malolactic fermentation and oak-barrel aging to develop the now familiar \"California Style\".", "The value of the Chardonnay grape to wine producers lies, perhaps counter-intuitively, in its neutrality. The notable grape breeder Harold Olmo said of Chardonnay, \"There is little in the way of distinct flavor, in either the grape or the new wine, until the fruit is almost overripe...However, it is exactly this delicacy and cleanness of taste...that make it... a delight to the consumer." ]

Martini, to address salient issues in viticulture through his research and breeding efforts. His work first gained wide recognition with the development of grape varieties that married the attributes of the so-called \"noble grapes\", such as Cabernet Sauvignon, that made them great raw material for wine, with the hardiness that would allow them to be grown in the heat of California's Central Valley, where most of California's wine grapes were produced at the time. \n\n Olmo traveled extensively to collect grape samples, and in the 1950s, helped establish California's first quarantine facility on the UC Davis campus to permit California growers to import foreign vines. \n\n Olmo was born in San Francisco's Mission District, and took an early interest in plants. He earned an undergraduate degree in horticulture from the University of California (UC) Davis and UC Berkeley, and a doctorate in genetics, from UC Berkeley.",

    "description" : "In 1960, American diplomat and author Morrill Cody invited five guests to  dinner at his home in Rome and blind tasted them on Hanzell's 1957 Chardonnay and some 1955 Corton Charlemagne. Three of the guests, \"quite knowledgeable on French wines\" and with \"a dim view of California wine,\" mistook the Hanzell for the Burgundy. As Cody wrote in a letter to James D. Zellerbach, \"Afterwards, we discussed the relative merits of the two wines and decided that your wine will stand up with any Burgundy. Yours is, of course, slightly lighter in body than the Corton Charlemagne, but that would not be true if it were compared with the Montrachet which it was your aim to produce.\"\n\n Though Hanzell wines did not achieve renown during Zellerbach's life, the dinner in Rome foreshadowed the Judgment of Paris, more than a decade later, and accounts of the dinner spread through California wine country. After Zellerbach's death, his wife Hana sold his last vintages in barrels at auction to Joseph Heitz. As Hugh Johnson writes in Vintage (1989),  \"It was then, in 1960, that the word got out. Hanzell wines, but especially Hanzell Chardonnay, had the buttery, half-smoked aromas and flavours that up to then had spelt only Meursault, Montrachet and Corton-Charlemagne. Nothing could have revived the hopes of California more than this unexpected discovery....the realization that French flavours were within their grasp changed the morale of the industry almost overnight.\"",

At the time, the decision to plant Chardonnay was controversial, as there were only around 200 documented acres of Chardonnay in California. Stony Hill may have been the first winery to plant a chardonnay vineyard after Prohibition, and the McCreas did so despite warnings from UC Davis that the variety was unlikely to succeed. UC Davis advised the couple to plant Gewurztraminer, Sémillon and Pinot Blanc to protect against the potential failure of the Chardonnay.",

Instead, the Chateau is made of stone with walls three to twelve feet thick, which provides natural insulation against outside heat or cold. Similarly, the structure is built into a hillside to further regulate temperature - something necessary for producing quality wines, but uncommon at the time. \n\n Today the winery is famous for producing the Chardonnay that won the Judgment of Paris wine competition in the whites category. All of the tasting's 11 judges awarded their top scores to Chardonnays from Chateau Montelena or Chalone Winery, another California wine producer.",

    "description" : "After Prohibition, Frank Schoonmaker, a New York merchant, was instrumental in the California wine industry's recovery after repeal. Schoonmaker founded Frank Schoonmaker Selections in 1936 and included California Chardonnay in his portfolio. Schoonmaker, who was critical of the common practice of naming California wines after French winegrowing regions, labelled his selections under the founder's name, followed by variety, producer, and region. \n\n While Schoonmaker was selling Wente Chardonnay on the East Coast, Wente was also using varietal labelling for their wines distributed on the West Coast. Like Schoonmaker, Ernest Wente believed that the long-term success for the winery was rooted in consumer education, and that varietal labelling was one step in that process. In 1936 Wente was the first California winery to produce a wine labeled as Chardonnay.",
