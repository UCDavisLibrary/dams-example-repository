Spurrier invited nine of France’s wine experts to participate in a blind tasting that pitted esteemed reds from Bordeaux and whites from Burgundy against Cabernet Sauvignons and Chardonnays from California. Spurrier curated the selection of Napa Valley wines with help from Gastaud-Gallagher and an American wine tour organizer, Joanne DePuy, who would later transport the California wines to Paris for the tasting.";

The horizon expanded for winemakers throughout the world, who were encouraged to imagine previously unconsidered regions for the production of fine wines made with the noble varieties. The wide-reaching spirit of competition and possibility that the tasting engendered also caused experimentation with winemaking methods and grape varieties to increase.", "Reflecting on the event forty years later for Time, Spurrier said, “The most important thing in my view is the Judgment of Paris created a template whereby unknown wines of high quality could go up against known benchmark wines of high quality, blind, provided they were in front of an incredibly reputable panel of judges. Davids from all over felt power to take on Goliaths. It was a great democratizing moment for vintners.”";

The blind tasting is now considered a pivotal step in establishing the credibility of the American wine and propelling the industry forward.\n\n Winiarski was in Italy studying the work of political philosopher Niccolo Machiavelli as part of his coursework for a PhD in political science from the University of Chicago when he became captivated by wine. He realized, during that year in Italy, that he wanted to pursue wine making. Ten years later, in 1964, he moved with his wife Barbara and their small children to Napa Valley to make that dream a reality.\n\n Initially, Winiarski worked at Souverain Winery before, in 1966, becoming the first winemaker at the Robert Mondavi Winery. Then in 1968, Winiarski took a position at Ivancie Cellars, selecting California grapes for a Colorado wine making endeavor. In 1970, together with a group of investors, he bought a 44-acre prune orchard in the Napa Valley. He planted Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot grapes on the land and built a winery near the vineyard and founded Stag’s Leap Wine Cellars in 1973.\n\n It was Winiarski’s first vintage, Stag’s Leap Wine Cellar 1973 Cabernet, was selected for that historic 1976 blind tasting, the Judgment of Paris and won first place among ten French and California red wines.\n\n In 2007, Stag’s Leap Wine Cellars was sold for $185 million to a partnership of St. Michelle Wine Estates of Washington State and Marchesi Antinori of Tuscany.";

Although Ridge Vineyards was founded in the early 1960s, wine production at the winery's Monte Bello location has a much longer history dating back to 1885, when an Italian doctor named Osea Perrone bought 180 acres near the top of Monte Bello Ridge. He planted vineyards and produced his first vintage under the name Monte Bello Winery in 1892.\n\n After Prohibition, the vineyard exchanged several hands before eventually becoming Ridge Vineyards after a group of engineers purchased it in 1959. Its first commercial wine, a Monte Bello Cabernet Sauvignon, was produced in 1962. Ridge Vineyard's 1971 Monte Bello Cabernet Sauvignon achieved international fame for its fifth place finish in the 1976 \"Judgement of Paris\" wine tasting.\n\n Ridge now produces wine at two winery locations in northern California. The original winery facilities are located at an elevation of 2,300 feet on Monte Bello Ridge in the Santa Cruz Mountains AVA. The other Ridge winery facilities are at Lytton Springs in the Dry Creek Valley AVA of Sonoma County.";

It then fell into disuse for several years although bootleggers are said to have made wine in the old stone cellar during the early years of the Prohibition. During the late 1920s and 1930s the property was owned by the Brandlin family. British chemist Jack Taylor and his wife Mary bought the property in 1941, and the estate received its current name. In 1968 the winery was bought by its present owner, Robert Travers and his wife Elinor. Under their direction, the aging facilities was enlarged, neighboring land purchased, and vineyard clearing, planting and replanting are an ongoing process. \n\n The winery received international recognition after its Cabernet sauvignon was selected for competition in the 1976 Judgment of Paris wine competition, where it came in ninth place of the ten red wines tasted. Robert Travers had agreed to sell three bottles of the still unreleased 1971 vintage for the event, although he did not consider it ready to drink. In the Wine Spectator Wine Tasting of 1986, blind tasters evaluated how the Cabernet Sauvignon wines had aged ten years after the Paris event. The 1971 Mayacamas Vineyards was ranked second. On the 30th anniversary of the Paris event, two panels of expert wine tasters tasted all the original red entries to assess how the wines had aged.
