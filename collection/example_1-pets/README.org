* Example 1 - Pets

This example collection is something like the most basic type of collection that
can be added into the system.  This example contains a simple set of digital
images, with a small amount of data about the pets.  Our goal is to take these
data and add them into our DAMs.

Let's start with the collection description.  That's stored in the `index.ttl`
file.  This file describes the collection. `index.ttl` is a pretty easy file to
understand, you'll see a title, and description and some keywords.
