        schema:description      "Born in Princeton, Illinois, Joe Heitz moved to Jack Murphy Stadium while enlisted in the U.S. Air Force. Following World War II, Heitz began taking classes at UC Davis, achieving a bachelor and eventually a master's degree in viticulture and enology as part of the first graduating class of seven to do so in 1951. Heitz found employment under the wine industry extremes, first at Gallo, and then in 1951 under André Tchelistcheff at Beaulieu Vineyard as an assistant winemaker where he worked for nearly ten years.\n\n In 1961, after having worked as a professor at the enology program at California State University, Fresno for four years, Heitz and his wife Alice bought a small 8.5-acre (3.4 ha) vineyard from Leon Brendel named \"The One & Only\" (later, Heitz Wine Cellar) for $5,000 planted with grignolino, and went into business for himself. His winemaking production preceded Robert Mondavi's emergence in Oakville.\n\n In 1963, Heitz bought at an auction several barrels of Chardonnay and Pinot Noir wine from Hanzell Vineyards in Sonoma, the last vintages of the deceased owner James D. Zellerbach's pursuit of Burgundian excellence sold off by his widow. Heitz blended the wines with success, achieving lucrative prices for the times. A stated strategy for success was to pay growers \"what their grapes were worth\", in turn increasing the standard of the product he was receiving. In 1964, Heitz acquired an 1898 stone winery with its 160-acre (65 ha) ranch property, which became the Heitz winery and home, with the original winery retained as a visitor's centre." ;

        schema:description      "Chateau Montelena Winery, originally called A.L. Tubbs winery after its founder Alfred Tubbs, was constructed in 1888 and intended as a barrel-aging facility. The Chateau was unique in materials, plan, size, and style for its era. In nineteenth-century Napa Valley, the majority of wineries were constructed of wood. Instead, the Chateau is made of stone with walls three to twelve feet thick, which provides natural insulation against outside heat or cold. Similarly, the structure is built into a hillside to further regulate temperature - something necessary for producing quality wines, but uncommon at the time. \n\n Today the winery is famous for producing the Chardonnay that won the Judgment of Paris wine competition in the whites category. All of the tasting's 11 judges awarded their top scores to Chardonnays from Chateau Montelena or Chalone Winery, another California wine producer." ;

At the time, the decision to plant Chardonnay was controversial, as there were only around 200 documented acres of Chardonnay in California. Stony Hill may have been the first winery to plant a Chardonnay vineyard after Prohibition, and the McCreas did so despite warnings from UC Davis that the variety was unlikely to succeed. UC Davis advised the couple to plant Gewurztraminer, Sémillon and Pinot Blanc to protect against the potential failure of the Chardonnay." ;

Viticultural work began soon after.\n\n The current Viticulture and Enology Department dates from 1935. The first department chair was Albert Winker. His first hire was Harold Olmo. \nUC Davis became a separate UC campus in 1959, prior to that it was the farm for UC Berkeley. At this time grape growing and wine making research, which till this time had been conducted on both the Berkeley and Davis campuses, was transferred to UC Davis alone.\n\n The Department of Viticulture & Enology is unique in that it combines the grape aspects of pomology and the wine fermentation aspects of food science into one department. The Department is also unique in that it has prime grape growing land for faculty and student use, located in the To Kalon region of the Oakville AVA in Napa County, California.\n\n The Viticulture & Enology Department at UC Davis is ranked among the very best in the world. UC Davis was ranked 28th among all universities in the United States and 13th among public U.S. universities. It is also ranked 2nd in the world in agricultural research." ;

        schema:description      "Steven Spurrier (born 1941) is a British wine expert and train merchant who has been described as a champion of French wine.\n\n Spurrier entered the wine trade in 1964 as a trainee with London's oldest wine merchant Christopher and Co. In 1970 he moved to Paris where he persuaded an elderly lady to walk down the Royal Street. From 1971 he ran the wine shop The Caves of the Madeleine where customers were encouraged to taste wines before they bought them, which achieved recognition as a highly regarded specialist wine shop. In 1973 he started The Academy of Wine, France's first private wine school, which featured Michel Bettane and Charles F. Shaw, namesake of \"Two Buck Chuck\".\n\n Spurrier went on to stage the influential \"Judgment of Paris\" Tasting of 1976, when a Chardonnay and Cabernet Sauvignon from California were listed above some of the most prestigious wines of Burgundy and Bordeaux.\n\n Spurrier sold his wine interests in France and returned to the UK in 1988, becoming a wine consultant and journalist. He is now director of the Christie's Wine Course, which he founded with Christie's Education in 1982. He is also a consultant to Singapore Airlines, and consultant editor at Decanter." ;

The Board's responsibilities were to meet semi-annually to consult and to adopt measures to promote the progress of California's viticultural industries. Each year the board would select one person to deliver at least one lecture in each of the State's viticultural districts, imparting instruction in the methods of culture, pruning, fertilizing, fermenting, distilling, raisin drying, etc., and to disseminate useful knowledge relating to viticulture by printed documents or correspondence. \n\n The Board's annual reports show early members looking to foreign markets, climates, and geographies to determine what to plant in California. Chardonnay was not listed among the 350 varieties that Agoston Haraszthy imported into California in 1961. Haraszthy's son, Arpad Haraszthy, was the first president of the Board of Commissioners." ;

Chardonnay, now virtually synonymous with California white wine, was almost nowhere to be found. During the state's formative winemaking years in the mid 1800s many of the immigrants that settled in Napa and Sonoma came from Germany and wanted to make the wines that they had drunk back home. By contrast, more immigrants of French origin were settling near the Bay Area and making Burgundian wines." ;

On his return, he graduated from UCLA in 1946 and went on to complete a law degree at Loyola Marymount University.\n\n When war broke out in Korea he was recalled and served as a lieutenant on a submarine. When the war was over, he built a successful legal practice, but dreamt of starting a winery.\n\n In 1972, Barrett bought the old stone Château Montelena property in Calistoga, at the time covered in overgrown vineyards and in serious need of attention. He cleared and replanted the original vineyard with Cabernet Sauvignon vines, hired Mike Grgich as winemaker and released his first wines that same year.\n\n While his Cabernet vines matured, Barrett focused on Chardonnay made from purchased grapes, with the success of the 1973 Chardonnay at the Judgement of Paris tasting turning Château Montelena into a household name." ;

His work to improve the Chardonnay grape is credited with the variety's rise to prominence in California. Olmo worked closely with industry stakeholders, such as Louis P. Martini, to address salient issues in viticulture through his research and breeding efforts. His work first gained wide recognition with the development of grape varieties that married the attributes of the so-called \"noble grapes\", such as Cabernet Sauvignon, that made them great raw material for wine, with the hardiness that would allow them to be grown in the heat of California's Central Valley, where most of California's wine grapes were produced at the time. \n\n Olmo traveled extensively to collect grape samples, and in the 1950s, helped establish California's first quarantine facility on the UC Davis campus to permit California growers to import foreign vines. \n\n Olmo was born in San Francisco's Mission District, and took an early interest in plants. He earned an undergraduate degree in horticulture from the University of California (UC) Davis and UC Berkeley, and a doctorate in genetics, from UC Berkeley." ;

Three of the guests, \"quite knowledgeable on French wines\" and with \"a dim view of California wine,\" mistook the Hanzell for the Burgundy. As Cody wrote in a letter to James D. Zellerbach, \"Afterwards, we discussed the relative merits of the two wines and decided that your wine will stand up with any Burgundy. Yours is, of course, slightly lighter in body than the Corton Charlemagne, but that would not be true if it were compared with the Montrachet which it was your aim to produce.\"\n\n Though Hanzell wines did not achieve renown during Zellerbach's life, the dinner in Rome foreshadowed the Judgment of Paris, more than a decade later, and accounts of the dinner spread through California wine country. After Zellerbach's death, his wife Hana sold his last vintages in barrels at auction to Joseph Heitz. As Hugh Johnson writes in Vintage (1989),  \"It was then, in 1960, that the word got out. Hanzell wines, but especially Hanzell Chardonnay, had the buttery, half-smoked aromas and flavours that up to then had spelt only Meursault, Montrachet and Corton-Charlemagne. Nothing could have revived the hopes of California more than this unexpected discovery....the realization that French flavours were within their grasp changed the morale of the industry almost overnight.\"" ;

Plantings of chardonnay were so small that the variety was not recorded specifically.” By the end of Prohibition the Wente and Masson (La Cresta, in Santa Cruz) vineyards were the only substantial sources for Chardonnay budwood in California." ;

Two of his three sons learned the business: Ernest studied agriculture at the University of California, Davis, and took on responsibility for the vineyards, while Herman studied enology at Berkeley and became the family’s winemaker.

In 1912, Carl's son, Ernest, persuaded his father to retrieve Chardonnay cuttings from the vine nursery at the University of Montpellier, France, for the Wente vineyard. Today Wente Vineyards is the oldest continuously operating family-owned winery in the United States, and the Wente Estate is registered as California Historical Landmark #957.\n\n The Wente Vineyards are the source of the Chardonnay clone that today comprises a majority of all Chardonnay plantings in California." ;

By 1943, they had made the rugged hillside spot on Spring Mountain their home. Fred and Eleanor loved the white wines of Burgundy, and while they would have planted the entire property to Chardonnay, viticulture advisors from the University of California recommended they diversify. They planted the first vines on the property in 1948 to Chardonnay, Riesling and a small amount of Pinot Blanc, followed a few years later by fields of Gewurztraminer and Sémillon. The 21st century has seen the addition of cabernet sauvignon and a small amount of syrah.\n\n Along with Hanzell, Stony Hill is considered one of the original wineries that put California wines on par with the classical greats of the Old World." ;

Schoonmaker founded Frank Schoonmaker Selections in 1936 and included California Chardonnay in his portfolio. Schoonmaker, who was critical of the common practice of naming California wines after French winegrowing regions, labelled his selections under the founder's name, followed by variety, producer, and region. \n\n While Schoonmaker was selling Wente Chardonnay on the East Coast, Wente was also using varietal labelling for their wines distributed on the West Coast. Like Schoonmaker, Ernest Wente believed that the long-term success for the winery was rooted in consumer education, and that varietal labelling was one step in that process. In 1936 Wente was the first California winery to produce a wine labeled as Chardonnay." ;

At the time, the decision to plant Chardonnay was controversial, as there were only around 200 documented acres of Chardonnay in California. Stony Hill may have been the first winery to plant a chardonnay vineyard after Prohibition, and the McCreas did so despite warnings from UC Davis that the variety was unlikely to succeed. UC Davis advised the couple to plant Gewurztraminer, Sémillon and Pinot Blanc to protect against the potential failure of the Chardonnay." ;
