From 1971 he ran the wine shop The Caves of the Madeleine where customers were encouraged to taste wines before they bought them, which achieved recognition as a highly regarded specialist wine shop. In 1973 he started The Academy of Wine, France's first private wine school, which featured Michel Bettane and Charles F. Shaw, namesake of \"Two Buck Chuck\".\n\n Spurrier went on to stage the influential \"Judgment of Paris\" Tasting of 1976, when a Chardonnay and Cabernet Sauvignon from California were listed above some of the most prestigious wines of Burgundy and Bordeaux.\n\n Spurrier sold his wine interests in France and returned to the UK in 1988, becoming a wine consultant and journalist. He is now director of the Christie's Wine Course, which he founded with Christie's Education in 1982. He is also a consultant to Singapore Airlines, and consultant editor at Decanter.",
