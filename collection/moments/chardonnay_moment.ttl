Chardonnay is the most popular wine in the U.S. and has maintained its lead for the last decade. Historical references note California plantings of Chardonnay dating back to the late 1800s, but production was limited due to low yields. This is the story of California Chardonnay pre-1980s, when plantings of the grape boomed as the wine grew in popularity.".

    schema:text "Though some records indicate that Chardonnay was present in California during the mid–late 19th century, it had a very limited role. Producers like Stony Hill Vineyard and Hanzell began to work with the grape with great success in the 1950s, but it existed purely on the margins; in 1960 there were only around 150 documented acres of Chardonnay in the state. But its popularity continued to grow at a rapid pace in the 1960s, and after Chateau Montelena's Chardonnay bested some of Burgundy's most iconic wines in the 1976 Judgment of Paris, Chardonnay's boom was supersonic.", "The value of the Chardonnay grape to wine producers lies, perhaps counter-intuitively, in its neutrality. The notable grape breeder Harold Olmo said of Chardonnay, \"There is little in the way of distinct flavor, in either the grape or the new wine, until the fruit is almost overripe...However, it is exactly this delicacy and cleanness of taste...that make it... a delight to the consumer.", "Chardonnay and its parent, Pinot noir, are the two classic varieties used in Champagne, in which Chardonnay’s neutral character leaves space for the expression of the mellow aromas developed in the bottle. The finesse of fine Chardonnay wines, opined winemaker, Eleanor Mcrea, \"is as unmistakable as Beethoven, [yet] there are many variations on the theme.\" That Chardonnay \"responds gracefully to many approaches\" makes it a canvas for the expression of vineyard and vinification. While some pioneering Chardonnay producers in California sought to reproduce the high acid, crisp style of Chablis, or of the richer quality of Burgundy white, still others have worked with riper grapes, acid-lowering malolactic fermentation and oak-barrel aging to develop the now familiar \"California Style\".";

Zellerbach’s last vintages, and showed that California could produce wine that would stand up to top white Burgundies.", "Timing, skill, doggedness, a knack for promotion, and the Judgment of Paris propelled Heitz’s Chardonnays into an international arena, but the stage for Chardonnay’s rise in California had been set decades before Prohibition, in Livermore, by a group of immigrant winemakers and a San Franciscan whose dry white wine won California’s first international wine award at the 1889 Paris Exposition.";

Chardonnay roots developed in Livermore nurseries and vineyards as well as in the Santa Cruz Mountains, where Livermore winegrower Paul Masson planted a second vineyard to Pinot Noir and Chardonnay, using cuttings from Burgundy purportedly from the vineyards of winegrower Louis Latour.";

Heitz found employment under the wine industry extremes, first at Gallo, and then in 1951 under André Tchelistcheff at Beaulieu Vineyard as an assistant winemaker where he worked for nearly ten years.\n\n In 1961, after having worked as a professor at the enology program at California State University, Fresno for four years, Heitz and his wife Alice bought a small 8.5-acre (3.4 ha) vineyard from Leon Brendel named \"The One & Only\" (later, Heitz Wine Cellar) for $5,000 planted with grignolino, and went into business for himself. His winemaking production preceded Robert Mondavi's emergence in Oakville.\n\n In 1963, Heitz bought at an auction several barrels of Chardonnay and Pinot Noir wine from Hanzell Vineyards in Sonoma, the last vintages of the deceased owner James D. Zellerbach's pursuit of Burgundian excellence sold off by his widow. Heitz blended the wines with success, achieving lucrative prices for the times. A stated strategy for success was to pay growers \"what their grapes were worth\", in turn increasing the standard of the product he was receiving. In 1964, Heitz acquired an 1898 stone winery with its 160-acre (65 ha) ranch property, which became the Heitz winery and home, with the original winery retained as a visitor's centre.";

Martini, to address salient issues in viticulture through his research and breeding efforts. His work first gained wide recognition with the development of grape varieties that married the attributes of the so-called \"noble grapes\", such as Cabernet Sauvignon, that made them great raw material for wine, with the hardiness that would allow them to be grown in the heat of California's Central Valley, where most of California's wine grapes were produced at the time. \n\n Olmo traveled extensively to collect grape samples, and in the 1950s, helped establish California's first quarantine facility on the UC Davis campus to permit California growers to import foreign vines. \n\n Olmo was born in San Francisco's Mission District, and took an early interest in plants. He earned an undergraduate degree in horticulture from the University of California (UC) Davis and UC Berkeley, and a doctorate in genetics, from UC Berkeley.";

Fred and Eleanor loved the white wines of Burgundy, and while they would have planted the entire property to Chardonnay, viticulture advisors from the University of California recommended they diversify. They planted the first vines on the property in 1948 to Chardonnay, Riesling and a small amount of Pinot Blanc, followed a few years later by fields of Gewurztraminer and Sémillon. The 21st century has seen the addition of cabernet sauvignon and a small amount of syrah.\n\n Along with Hanzell, Stony Hill is considered one of the original wineries that put California wines on par with the classical greats of the Old World.";

At the time, the entire state of California had fewer than 200 acres planted to Chardonnay.\n\n Hanzel would go on to pioneer in the California several winemaking techniques that would become associated with the style of California Chardonnay including the use of barrel-aging, malolactic fermentation, and the use of inert gases and anaerobic winemaking.

At this time grape growing and wine making research, which till this time had been conducted on both the Berkeley and Davis campuses, was transferred to UC Davis alone.\n\n The Department of Viticulture & Enology is unique in that it combines the grape aspects of pomology and the wine fermentation aspects of food science into one department. The Department is also unique in that it has prime grape growing land for faculty and student use, located in the To Kalon region of the Oakville AVA in Napa County, California.\n\n The Viticulture & Enology Department at UC Davis is ranked among the very best in the world.

    schema:description "Harold Olmo brought selections of Chardonnay from the Martini Carneros vineyards to the Foundation Plant Services for heat treatment to produce virus free planting material. Two of these selections were combined and distributed by UC Davis viticulture specialist, Curtis Alley, as referred to as Clone 108, the Davis Clone or the (new) Wente Clone. Throughout the 1960s, most of the Chardonnay in Washington State, and half of that in Napa, was planted with Clone 108.  \n\n In 1969, Clone 108 was disambiguated into FPS 04 and 05, which were registered by the California Department of Food & Agriculture\"s Grapevine Registration & Certification Program. This designation is given to selections that have been confirmed as true to variety by experts using visual observations, DNA-based testing or both, and have undergone virus testing.  \n\n This dependable, high-yield clone, and others from this program of selection and pathogen treatment, made Chardonnay commercially viable in California.";

The Board's responsibilities were to meet semi-annually to consult and to adopt measures to promote the progress of California's viticultural industries. Each year the board would select one person to deliver at least one lecture in each of the State's viticultural districts, imparting instruction in the methods of culture, pruning, fertilizing, fermenting, distilling, raisin drying, etc., and to disseminate useful knowledge relating to viticulture by printed documents or correspondence. \n\n The Board's annual reports show early members looking to foreign markets, climates, and geographies to determine what to plant in California. Chardonnay was not listed among the 350 varieties that Agoston Haraszthy imported into California in 1961. Haraszthy's son, Arpad Haraszthy, was the first president of the Board of Commissioners.";

In “The Story of California Chardonnay,” wine writer Elaine Chukan Brown notes that “In the grape harvest report of 1930, total vineyard acreage in California was around 600,000 acres, with the statewide total of white grapes planted, across all varieties, being just 7,000 acres, consisting primarily of Riesling and Sémillon. Plantings of chardonnay were so small that the variety was not recorded specifically.” By the end of Prohibition the Wente and Masson (La Cresta, in Santa Cruz) vineyards were the only substantial sources for Chardonnay budwood in California.";

    schema:description "In 1960, American diplomat and author Morrill Cody invited five guests to  dinner at his home in Rome and blind tasted them on Hanzell's 1957 Chardonnay and some 1955 Corton Charlemagne. Three of the guests, \"quite knowledgeable on French wines\" and with \"a dim view of California wine,\" mistook the Hanzell for the Burgundy. As Cody wrote in a letter to James D. Zellerbach, \"Afterwards, we discussed the relative merits of the two wines and decided that your wine will stand up with any Burgundy. Yours is, of course, slightly lighter in body than the Corton Charlemagne, but that would not be true if it were compared with the Montrachet which it was your aim to produce.\"\n\n Though Hanzell wines did not achieve renown during Zellerbach's life, the dinner in Rome foreshadowed the Judgment of Paris, more than a decade later, and accounts of the dinner spread through California wine country. After Zellerbach's death, his wife Hana sold his last vintages in barrels at auction to Joseph Heitz. As Hugh Johnson writes in Vintage (1989),  \"It was then, in 1960, that the word got out. Hanzell wines, but especially Hanzell Chardonnay, had the buttery, half-smoked aromas and flavours that up to then had spelt only Meursault, Montrachet and Corton-Charlemagne. Nothing could have revived the hopes of California more than this unexpected discovery....the realization that French flavours were within their grasp changed the morale of the industry almost overnight.\"";
