This is the tale of how California brought its love affair with Bordeaux grown Cabernet Sauvignon stateside and cultivated it into the reigning king of Napa Valley reds.".

The grape is usually associated with dry, full-flavored wines with aromas and flavors that include notes of berries, currants, cassis, bell pepper, and toasty oak.", "At the time, Americans considered Bordeaux wines, which are often made from Cabernet Sauvignon grapes, to be the gold standard, and Napa winemakers sought to satisfy demand by importing wine grapes grapes from Bordeaux and learning French winemaking techniques.

The Mays met the Heitz family after enjoying two bottles of Heitz wine left behind as a welcome gift by the home's previous owners, Belle and Barney Rhodes (the Rhodes' Bella Oaks Vineyard was another of Heitz' longtime sources).\n\n May was a biology teacher in Ojai, Calif., before moving to Napa. He learned grapegrowing on the job, with the benefit of Joe Heitz's advice (Heitz was a winemaker at Beaulieu Vineyard for a decade before founding his winery in 1961). Heitz was so impressed with the quality of May's grapes that he was inspired to create a single-vineyard labeled Cabernet with the 1966 vintage. Their partnership lasted until Heitz' death in 2000; Heitz' son, David, succeeded his father as winemaker, and the families' relationship continues to this day.\n\n May was an early environmentalist, says his wife, Martha. \"He was a member of the Sierra Club, and a great believer in leaving the land as it is and not trying to change everything,\" she said. \"If there was a tree in the middle of a vineyard you didn't have to remove it, or if you had a hill in the middle of the area you didn't have to flatten it.\" Early on the Mays dry farmed their vineyard, only adding drip irrigation later when drought years required water to start new vines.";

    schema:description "Joe Heitz was born in Princeton, Illinois, in 1919. He joined the Army Air Corps after two years at a junior college, and for most of World War II served as a mechanic at an Air Corps base near Fresno. He got his start in winemaking with evening work at Italian Swiss Colony. \n\n In 1948 Heitz enrolled at the University of California at Davis, where he received a B.S. in Enology. In 1959 he returned to the university for graduate studies and eventually achieved an M.S. in Food Science (with a focus on distillation). Following his studies, he worked for E. & J. Gallo in Modesto for a time, and then in 1950 went to work for Beaulieu Vineyard as an assistant winemaker (his resumé says \"Plant Manager\"). He stayed at Beaulieu almost 10 years, working under André Tchelistcheff.\n\n From January 1958 to June 1961, Heitz was an instructor of enology at California State University, Fresno. After leaving that post, Heitz, with his wife, Alice, bought a small 8.5-acre vineyard from Leon Brendel named \"The One & Only\" (later, Heitz Wine Cellar) for $5,000. The property was planted with grignolino.\n\n In 1963 Heitz bought at an auction several barrels of Chardonnay and Pinot Noir wine from Hanzell Vineyards in Sonoma. They were the last vintages of the deceased owner James D. Zellerbach, sold off by his widow. Heitz blended, bottled, and sold the wines for prices that were considered astronomical at the time, around $7 a bottle. His intent was to pay growers \"what their grapes were worth,\" thereby increasing the standard of the product he was receiving.\n\n Heitz bought his first Cabernet Sauvignon grapes from Tom and Martha May, the owners of Martha's Vineyard, in 1965. He blended them into his regular Cabernet that year, but the result was so good that in 1966 he vinified the Mays' grapes separately. That was the beginning of a California legend.\n\n In the mid-1960's, Mr. Heitz moved his home and winery across the valley to an almost hidden spot off the Silverado Trail known as Spring Valley. He expanded over the years, eventually owning 350 acres of grapes. He continued to make Cabernet with grapes from Martha's Vineyard and from Bella Oaks Vineyard, the source of his second cabernet.", "#Image Credit".

It was in France that he discovered his second passion—wine. Strong returned to America in the 50s to continue his dance career but his old age ultimately forced him to switch careers. He moved to Northern California with his wife and began making wine.\n\n Strong bought his distinguished vineyard, Rodney Strong Vineyards (previously called Sonoma Vineyards), in 1962 in Sonoma County. Strong reached many milestones with his vineyard. In 1965, he replanted Chardonnay vines, which became the first to be planted in what would later be known as Chalk Hill AVA. In 1968, he was the first to plant Pinot Noir in Russian River Valley by using climate data from UC Davis. Strong's greatest accomplishment happened when he was one of the first people to acknowledge the prospects of Alexander Valley. In 1974, he released the first Alexander Valley single vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon. Despite this breakthrough, Strong's company was not doing well, and he eventually sold it. Although he was no longer the owner, Strong continued to play an active role until his death. He is still remembered as a transformative visionary in the wine industry.";

    schema:description "Dr. Harold Olmo was a plant breeder and faculty member at the University of California Davis, who introduced around 30 grape varieties and improved many more. Due to his work to improve the yield and resiliency of the Chardonnay grape, Olmo is often credited with the variety's rise to prominence in California. Olmo worked closely with California winemakers, such as Louis P. Martini, to address salient issues in viticulture through his research and breeding efforts. His work first gained wide recognition with the development of grape varieties that married the attributes of the so-called \"noble grapes,\" including Cabernet Sauvignon (attributes that made them great raw material for wine) with the hardiness that would allow them to be grown in the heat of California's Central Valley, where most of California's wine grapes were produced at the time. \n\n Olmo traveled extensively to collect grape samples and in the 1950s helped establish California's first quarantine facility on the UC Davis campus to permit California growers to import foreign vines. \n\n In the 1940s and 50s, Olmo took a selection of Cabernet Sauvignon from Larkmead trials and planted the budwood at the Oakville Station. The \"Oakville Clones,\" as they've been since been called, contributed to building the Napa Cab industry in the 1960s. \n\n Olmo was born in San Francisco's Mission District, and took an early interest in plants. He earned an undergraduate degree in horticulture from the University of California (UC) Davis and UC Berkeley, and a doctorate in genetics, from UC Berkeley.";

    schema:description "André Tchelistcheff was America's most influential winemaker following Prohibition. Born and raised in Russia, Tchelistcheff served in the White Russian army during the Allied armies' retreat through the Crimea to Gallipoli. He left the service in 1921 and enrolled as a student at the Agriculture Institute of National Agronomy in Brno, in Czechoslovakia, to study agronomy. \n\n Tchelistcheff began his career as an agronomist in 1929, working in the experimental station in Dubrovnik. After his first marriage, he moved to France with his wife, hoping to transition into the wine industry. He undertook post-graduate courses at the National Agronomic Institute in Paris and also worked in the champagne cellars of Moët & Chandon Champagne. In 1938 he moved to California to begin work and winemaker for Beaulieu Vineyard.\n\n Today Tchelistcheff is widely called the \"dean of American winemakers,\" because he mentored many industry pioneers, including Robert Mondavi, Louis Martini, and Warren Winiarski. He provided significant contributions to the techniques of cold fermentation, vineyard frost protection, malolactic fermentation, and the development of winemaking regions in Carneros, California, Oregon, and Washington.\n\n Tchelistcheff was vice president of Beaulieu Vineyards for 35 years, until he retired from the winery in 1973, four years after the sale of Beaulieu to Heublein Inc. While at Beaulieu, Tchelistcheff created some of the finest post-Prohibition California cabernets and developed the winery's \"private reserve\" appellation. \n\n He spent the second half of his life consulting for wineries throughout the valley, including Beaulieu in the '90s, and he operated a private wine laboratory in St. Helena for fifteen years.  He was inducted into the Culinary Institute of America's Vintner's Hall of Fame in 2007.\n\n In his introduction to Ruth Teiser's oral history interview with Tchelistcheff for the Bancroft Library, Maynard Amerine wrote, \"André is a philosopher. He has been, I think, most comfortable with people who have a well-defined basic philosophy of life and of wine quality. He is at the same time a missionary and again most compatible with those who accept his missionary goals. But he is also a pragmatist, accepting most of what is in the wine industry even though it sometimes violates his principles. He is thus a most complex person.\"";

In his first year at the ranch, he produced 14,000 gallons of wine, with grapes probably harvested from established vineyards. Over the next 10 years, Drummond contributed much to the quality of California wines. He was one of the first growers to graft imported French varieties onto old Mission vines. He planted the North Coast’s first Bordeaux vineyard, importing Cabernet Sauvignon cuttings from well-known wineries like Château Lafite Rothschild. His Dunfillan Winery, named for his ancestral home in Ireland, produced California’s first commercially bottled Cabernet Sauvignon. Introduced in 1884, it was the “most admired wine” at that year’s California Viticultural Convention.\n\n Drummond planted over 150 grape varieties. Working closely with the University of California’s Experimental Agricultural Station at Davis, he took a great interest in testing which varieties were best suited to different soils. Drummond was one of the first grape growers to show an interest in Chardonnay and the first California winemaker to commercially bottle Merlot. He imported several varieties of Pinot Noir and used them to make a blush wine called Oeil de Perdrix, or “Eye of the Partridge.” The Drummond Ranch also raised dairy and beef cattle, chickens, hogs, hay, and fruit trees. Drummond and his family are said to have lived in one of the most beautiful homes in Sonoma Valley, a two-story square house near the winery.";

    schema:description "A recognized pioneering leader in the California wine industry, Louis P. Martini was one of the first winemakers to ferment wine in stainless steel tanks and also one of the first winemakers to plant the Wente clone of Chardonnay in the Carneros region. He also led the charge in mechanically harvesting wine grapes.\n\n Martini studied at Davis when it was known as the University Farm under the mentorship of Dr. Maynard Amerine, graduating in 1941. After serving in the Army Air Corps in England during World War II, Martini returned to the winery as vice president and production manager. Martini was a charter member of the American Society of Enology and Viticulture.\n\n According to Martini's granddaughter, Carolyn Martini, \"My grandfather's idea was that if you wanted to be in business pick something that was not an essential, or the government would regulate and control you in troubled times, but also not a pure luxury, because people would not buy when times got tough.  Something in between.  Not an essential, not a luxury.  To an Italian wine fit the category.  \n\n Cabernet is called the King of varietals.  Besides making interesting blends, the grapes are tough, late maturing and sturdy against inclement weather and produce a pretty hearty crop.  And Napa is perfect in the traits it lends to its Cabernets.  As the name got known and the popularity spread the brand grew.  Even though Martini produced at one point 14 varietals and 6 generics (numbers varied) Cabernet grew to be close to half our sales.  Another of my grandfather's ideas was that true wine drinking nations drank 2/3rds red to 1/3rd white so thats what our brand mix was by volume.\"";

    schema:description "American wine cultivator, Henry Walker Crabb (also known H. W. Crabb), planted the first vineyard in what is now known as the Oakville AVA, in 1868. He named the vineyard “To Kalon,” meaning “most beautiful” in Greek.\n\n To Kalon is arguably the United States’ most renowned vineyard due to its history. The vineyard suffered for a time under numerous changes of ownership following the death of Crabb. Acres of To Kalon were sold off, but fortunately, Martin Stelling, a business man from San Francisco, purchased 337 acres and renewed the vineyard. He expanded To Kalon by purchasing 1,700 more acres, naming it the “Stelling Extension.” After his death, Stelling's wife sold pieces of that property.\n\n Cesare Mondavi and his sons, Robert and Peter, bought 429 acres, as well as part of the Stelling Extension in 1962. There were many familial disputes over the land, but Robert Mondavi eventually declared ownership over the 429 acres and the 246 additional acres he purchased on his own. Today, his winery owns 328 acres. Although this land was not originally part of Crabb’s vineyard, Mondavi claims it as part of To Kalon.\n\n To Kalon became the center of a legal battle between Mondavi and another vineyard owner, Andy Beckstoffer. Beckstoffer purchased acres from the vineyard in 1993 and soon advertised his fruit as To Kalon. This caused Mondavi to sue Schrader Cellars, who had purchased fruit from Beckstoffer, for advertising To Kalon on their labels. Beckstoffer sued Mondavi for advertising false information, arguing Mondavi’s vineyard was from the Stelling Extension, not the original To Kalon. Both parties eventually settled the battle, giving Beckstoffer the right to advertise his products with To Kalon. Despite its tense history, To Kalon is regarded as one of the best vineyards to produce Cabernet Sauvignon.";

Tchelistcheff also became a mentor to other important winemakers such as Mike Grgich (whose Chateau Montelena Chardonnay won the Judgment of Paris), Joe Heitz of Heitz Wine Cellars, and Robert Mondavi. By the 1940s, Beaulieu wines were served at all major White House functions.\n\n In the 1950s and 1960s Beaulieu was considered one of the \"big four\" Napa Valley producers, along with Inglenook (also in Rutherford), Charles Krug, and Louis Martini.\n\n The winery was purchased by international conglomerate Heublein Inc., in 1969. Heublein was later acquired by RJR Nabisco, then sold to Grand Metropolitan in 1987. Grand Metropolitan became Diageo plc in 1997 through a merger with Guinness.

In September 1906 the University took possession of land near Davisville (later renamed Davis). The first instruction began with 40 students in 1908. Viticultural work began soon after.\n\n The current Viticulture and Enology Department dates from 1935. The first department chair was Albert Winker. His first hire was Harold Olmo. \nUC Davis became a separate UC campus in 1959, prior to that it was the farm for UC Berkeley. At this time grape growing and wine making research, which till this time had been conducted on both the Berkeley and Davis campuses, was transferred to UC Davis alone.\n\n The Department of Viticulture & Enology is unique in that it combines the grape aspects of pomology and the wine fermentation aspects of food science into one department. The Department is also unique in that it has prime grape growing land for faculty and student use, located in the To Kalon region of the Oakville AVA in Napa County, California.\n\n The Viticulture & Enology Department at UC Davis is ranked among the very best in the world. UC Davis was ranked 28th among all universities in the United States and 13th among public U.S. universities. It is also ranked 2nd in the world in agricultural research.";

Drummond did much to improve the quality of California wines. He was one of the few early winegrowers to show an interest in Chardonnay, which he imported in 1880. He imported Cabernet Sauvignon cuttings from Château Margaux, Château Lafite Rothschild, and the Hermitage in Bordeaux. The Drummond Ranch's 1882 Cabernet Sauvignon was the most admired wine at the California Viticultural Convention. His vineyard was about 150 acres. After his death, his land was sold. It went not to a winegrower but to the wealthiest black woman in San Francisco, Mary Ellen Pleasant.";

After visiting Lodi, California, Robert’s father chose to move the family there because the climate, the landscape, and the way of life all reminded him of the Italian countryside. In 1943, Robert took charge of the family wine business, and in 1966, he established his namesake winery in nearby Oakville, California, at the heart of Napa Valley. For the home of his winery, he chose 12 acres of To Kalon Vineyard, one of the finest for growing Cabernet Sauvignon in the world. He chose To Kalon because “It has ideal soils, sunlight, and rain. It has a magical nature.” And it’s from this first-growth vineyard that Robert Mondavi began his quest to bring world-class Napa Valley wines to the world. The vineyard has since grown to encompass 450 uniquely complex and resilient acres that provide a perfect foundation for fine-quality grapes to thrive, from season to season, under a broad range of growing conditions that allow the winemaking team to produce wines with elegant, concentrated flavors and fine tannins.";

I compared this Cabernet\nwith generic wines such as Burgundies and Clarets—the public didn't\nknow Cabernet then—and selected definitely Cabernet as the best Beaulieu red wine in the cellar, which actually was the master key to all my\nfuture career in California, because I said to myself, 'This is my\nfirst impression, and very probably I have to check my first impression.'\nI said, 'I will go to California.'

A Californian wine rated best in each category, which caused surprise as France was generally regarded as being the foremost producer of the world's best wines.";
